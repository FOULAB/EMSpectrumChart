# Electromagnetic Spectrum Chart

A chart of the EM spectrum correcting some issues on the Industry Canada poster.

Industry canada has a 
[great poster](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/2018_Canadian_Radio_Spectrum_Chart.PDF/$FILE/2018_Canadian_Radio_Spectrum_Chart.PDF)
 on their website showing how various frequency bands are allocated.  At the bottom, there is this cute diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Unfortunately, it has a few problems, actually a lot of problems.

I first made this chart in 2012, as something that can be printed and stuck over the erroneous one on that poster.  I did write them about it back then, and when they revised it in 2018, one could have hoped that the EM chart at the bottom would have been fixed.  No dice.  So here is this chart again, for those who find the glitches irritating.

The chart is generated as PDF by Processing 3.  The PDF is available for download directly here as well as the source.  All licensed as Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
